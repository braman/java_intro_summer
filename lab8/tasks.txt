Your tasks in this lab will to add the exceptions inside you're code.
Let's assume that you'll have InvalidNameException and InvalidAgeException and so on.
So your task is to validate the user input for the correctness of the input data, 
for example, name could be a string with only one space and only letters;
age could be only positive numbers between 1 and 150, and so on.
Inside your add user operation you'll need to verify the correctness of the input data
and then throw an exception if some field is wrong.
Also you'll need to catch this exception some where in your code and print user friendly error.
